## UCI Project 1 - Netflix Data Analysis - Written Report and Analysis
 

**Brief Description:** For our group project, we explored user preferences for Netflix, the popular streaming platform globally, and analyzed the dataset across multiple key verticals. These include the following:
 

-   Volume and growth of Netflix content across countries
    
-   Consumption of Netflix content across countries (including Top 10 countries)
    
-   Distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows on Netflix (including their average age)
    
-   Distribution of Netflix ratings across TV Shows and Movies and
    
-   Heatmap that outlines the target population distribution of Netflix content
    

  

**Netflix Content Overview:**

-   Movies constitute a vast majority of content produced on Netflix (approx. 72%) with the remaining 28% being TV shows. This could point to stronger leverage for Netflix to buy licensing rights for movies compared to TV shows and related user preferences towards consuming movies.
    
-   2016 marked the year Netflix went global outside of the US market and has since consistently added more content over the years, with 2019 marking an all-time record of 250+ media assets to its content library. These are added at a steady rate throughout the year with targeted spikes towards the fall and winter months, traditionally the busy media advertising and content seasons.
    

  

**Netflix Content - Production and Consumption:**

-   The United States far outpaces the rest of the world in terms of the content being produced with India coming in at the second largest market. The total list of titles being produced in the US (3684) is only slightly lower than the rest of the countries in the top 10 list combined (~3800). This indicates that Netflix has a lot of potential and growth opportunities in non-US markets in the short to medium time frame.
    
-   Barring Japan and South Korea, all of the top 10 markets produce more movies than TV shows, reflecting a strong user preference for movies. Based on the sample dataset, Germany and Spain have exactly the same number of titles (232) produced despite the split across TV shows and Movies for each of these countries being different.
    
-   Despite not being in the top 10 list of countries for content produced, Taiwan has the largest average age of TV shows produced on Netflix. Interestingly, Japan is in the top 3 countries for the average age of both Movies and TV shows on Netflix, indicating strong customer loyalty and user retention for the companyâ€™s media catalog.
    
-   The United States and India are the only two countries that have produced more than 1000 titles across both TV shows and Movies. Despite being in the top 10 list of countries that have produced content on Netflix, South Korea is the only country that has produced ~2x TV shows over Movies, indicating a strong bias towards TV shows among its Netflix users.


**Netflix Content Ratings - Overview and Analysis:**

- The majority of the content produced on Netflix is geared towards the matured audience with TV-MA and TV-14 marking the top two categories. TV Shows, on the other hand, outpace Movies in terms of content produced in the kids category, primarily TV-Y and TV-G.
    
-   Based on the analysis of the heatmap that plots the normalized distribution of target audience across the top 10 countries based on media ratings, it is clear that almost all countries cater to the adult categories for content production. India is the only exception where the majority of the titles being produced are for the teen population (~56%).
    
-   Two of the top 10 categories of media content ratings on Netflix (PG-13 and PG) have no TV shows produced at all - this indicates a strong preference for Movies in this target audience.
    
-   Japan has an interesting distribution of its content across the kids and teens segment with only 1% of the overall content produced in the country being targeted at kids while teens form the largest target segment at 38% with adults coming close at around 35%.
